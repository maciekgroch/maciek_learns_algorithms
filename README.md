Hi, I am Maciek. In this repository you can find the code I developed while 
following Algorithms courses: 

* Divide and Conquer, Sorting and Searching, and Randomized Algorithms on https://www.coursera.org/learn/algorithms-divide-conquer
* Graph Search, Shortest Paths, and Data Structures on https://www.coursera.org/learn/algorithms-graphs-data-structures

One note is I do not share code I used to solve programming 
assignments as that would not be fair.

I also followed the book on algorithms: 

* Dasgupta, Sanjoy, Christos H. Papadimitriou, and Umesh V. Vazirani. 
*Algorithms*. Boston: McGraw-Hill Higher Education, 2008
