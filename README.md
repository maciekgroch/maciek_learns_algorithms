Hi, I am Maciek. In this repository you can find the code I developed while 
following Algorithms courses: 

https://www.coursera.org/learn/algorithms-divide-conquer

One note is I do not share code I used to solve programming 
assignments as that would not be fair.

I also followed the book on algorithms: 

Dasgupta, Sanjoy, Christos H. Papadimitriou, and Umesh V. Vazirani.
